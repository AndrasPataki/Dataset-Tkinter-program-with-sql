Hello, Welcome to the TextBox Example with database. 
This program serves as an example to connect a text box to a SQL database.
There is no secret to running it. Have Python 3 installed and Tkinter. 
Type in the terminal: python3 textbox.py and the program will run. 
I recommend Mysql Database manager
